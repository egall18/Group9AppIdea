App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

Mobile: What makes this app unique is because we as a human need a decision to make based on many choices in our life, and this app would help us make a decision based on one of our choices.
Story: Our value of this app is pretty clear to the audience because it will help them alot in tough situations, our friends and peers would also react positively because of how convinient this app will be.
Market: We are hoping this app would benefit large audience because it's in our nature to pick 1 thing out of our many choices. This app is directed specifically towards audience who needs to make 1 decision based on many choices they have throughout the day.
Habit: We would hope that the user would use this app everyday to help them motivate themself instead of finding a decision and not wanting to do it in the end.
Scope: We would say that this app would be very challenging, because we have to require many user input and we would need to implement that input into the randomized generator. Hard coding this app would be a challenge to use.
